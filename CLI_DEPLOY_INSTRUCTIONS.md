# Vercel CLI Deployment - Step by Step

## Current Step: Initial Setup Prompt

**What you see:** `? Set up and deploy "~/Desktop/buildfast/ChatApp"? (Y/n)`

**What to do:** 
- Type **`Y`** and press Enter
- OR just press Enter (Y is the default)

---

## Next Steps (After you press Y):

The CLI will then ask you several questions:

1. **"Which scope do you want to deploy to?"**
   - Select your account (Yusuf Diallo's projects)

2. **"Link to existing project?"**
   - Type **`y`** (YES) - This is important!
   - You want to link to your existing "build-fast-chat" project

3. **"What's the name of your existing project?"**
   - Type: **`build-fast-chat`**
   - OR use arrow keys to select it from the list

4. **"In which directory is your code located?"**
   - Just press Enter (current directory is correct)

5. **Vercel will then:**
   - Build your project locally
   - Upload and deploy to production
   - Show you the deployment URL

---

## Summary of Your Answers:
- Set up and deploy? → **Y** (just press Enter)
- Link to existing project? → **y** (yes)
- Project name? → **build-fast-chat**
- All other questions → Press Enter (use defaults)

---

This will deploy your latest code (commit `8c2b68a` with the new design) directly to Vercel!
